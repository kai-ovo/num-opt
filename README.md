# Numerical Optimization
This repository contains implementations of numerous popular numerical algorithms, including proximal algorithms and their popular variants, and Newton's methods and their variants. Two case studies in the form of Jupyter Notebooks are also provided: the LASSO problem and the Non-negative Matrix Factorization (NMF) problem. In particular for the NMF problem, we conduct extensive literature review and mathematically prove some insightful algorithmic properties.
